## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

If in RStudio, when you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

```{r loading package and data, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2) # Run the code "install.packages("ggplot2")" without the quotes to install this, if necessary.
library(readxl) # Run if using Excel file, run code "install.packages("readxl")" without the quotes to install this, if necessary.
library(dplyr) # Run if rearranging bars in chart by specific order, run code "install.packages("dplyr")" without the quotes to install this, if necessary.
library(report) # For report function
library(scales) # For percentage scales on each bar

# Recommendation: save this .Rmd to the same folder that the data is in

# read.csv("file path") # Reads in a comma-separated file
# read_xlsx("file path") # Reads in an Excel data file
# read.delim("file path") # Reads in a tab-delimited file (e.g. documents ending in )
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to *prevent printing of the embedded R code* that generated the plot. Erase this if you wish to include your data entry and package loading in your output.

```{r}
report(iris$Species) 

# create a percentage for each category to add to the barplot bars later
irisNew <- iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
 summarize(count = n()) %>%  
  # count records by species
 mutate(pct = count/sum(count))  
# find percent of total by dividing count by sum of count 

# (e.g. percentage of virginica = 50 virginica irises / 150 total irises = .33)

# extremely basic barchart with little to no design edits.. this can be used as a reference
ggplot(irisNew, aes(Species, pct, fill = Species)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(pct)), position = position_stack(vjust = 1.05)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  ggtitle("Reference Bar Chart for Frequency of Iris Species") 
# In the following code, we do not use the irisNew data because there are ways to input percentages without having to reformat data

```
We will use the iris dataset to format barcharts, which involves:

* 50 irises belonging in each of the 3 categorical Species groups (setosa, versicolor, and virginica)

Where:

* 33% are of the setosa species
* 33% are of the versicolor species
* 33% are of the virginica species

This can be represented through use of a barchart. Below is code supported by ggplot2 that shows exactly how this can be done: 

## Vertical Barchart Template 
### Bar Color Indicates Level (color not predetermined; automatic)
```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = factor(Species), y = prop.table(stat(count)), 
                        # x can represent any categorical variable of interest 
                        # here y represents the percentage
                          fill = factor(Species), 
                        # this line colors each bar by Species category
                          label = scales::percent(prop.table(stat(count))))) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
  # dodge preserves the vertical and horizontal size of the bar and does not allow bars to overlap
    geom_text(stat = "count", 
              position = position_dodge(.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, .35), breaks = NULL) + 
  # changes the y-axis from numerical count to a percentage scale
  # the limits part extends the y axis so that the percentage labels don't get smooshed,
  # where 0 is the lowest limit and .35 (or 35%) is the highest the chart will go
  # while the breaks = NULL code removes y-axis tick marks and labels
ggtitle("Figure 1", 
        # title of the histogram
    subtitle = "Frequency of Species of Iris") + 
  # the subtitle of the chart
    labs(x = "Species", y = "Percent", fill = "Species") + 
  # The X- and Y-axis labels along with the legend ("fill")
    theme_bw() + 
  # gets rid of the gray background in the reference chart
  # placing this theme_bw() line after the following 2 lines will not bold the figure title, be cognizant of this
theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.2), face = "bold", vjust = 1.5), 
      # Bolding the plot title
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
      # Bolding the axes titles
      panel.grid.major=element_blank()) # Removes grid lines behind bars

```

  # Width ranges from 0 to 1. The fill color can be any hex code you wish it to be. This one is teal blue.
    geom_text(stat = "count", 
              position = position_dodge(.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) + 
  # breaks = NULL rids y-axis of tick marks or percentage labels (delete if you want this included!) +

### Where Each Bar Color Indicates Level (color predetermined)
```{r}
# Plots with bars as different colors
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = prop.table(stat(count)), 
   # X can represent any categorical variable of interest but here y represents the percentage
                          label = scales::percent(prop.table(stat(count))))) +

```

## Vertical Barchart with Reordered Levels
### Using {dplyr} pipe-in functions
```{r}
# Reordering according to a specific list of categories. Before doing this, the data itself needs to be re-ordered via several functions found in the {dplyr} package
iris %>% 
  # begin with the iris dataset
  arrange(Species) %>% 
  # Arranging the Species variable of the iris dataset
  mutate(Species = factor(Species, levels = c("virginica", "versicolor", "setosa"))) %>% 
  # the mutate() function actually creates a new column with reordered levels by using information from the previously unordered column. 
  # Within c() is where you specify the exact order you wish the bars to follow (from left to right)
  # Below this is where you would pipe in the typical barchart code that we have used in the previous figures
  ggplot(aes(x = Species, y = prop.table(stat(count)),

  # Returning to the typical plot code except data = iris is not necessary 
  # since you have already piped it in via %>%

    geom_bar(fill = "#367588", width = 0.2) + 
  # This hex code is for darker teal blue
  ggtitle("Figure 4",
          subtitle = "Frequency of Species of Iris") +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Frequency", 
       caption = "We used the {dplyr} package to 'pipe' (see: %>%) multiple R commands 
       into one instead of going into the actual dataframe and 
       re-ordering the data itself. Notice that the bars 
       are ordered in reverse when compared to Figure 1-3") + 
  # Adds caption to bottom right of chart. Make sure to divide sentences into spaced chunks so that they are 
 # legible, otherwise the text will not appear normally
  theme_bw() + 
  # placing this line after the following 2 lines will not bold the figure title, so be cognizant of this
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.2), face = "bold", vjust = 1.5), 
        # Bolding the plot title
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),

## Horizontal Barchart Template
### Bar Colors Do Not Indicate Level

    geom_text(stat = "count",

## CO2 Data Exploration
### Simple Counts & Frequencies
```{r}
report(CO2$Treatment)
report(CO2$Type)
```
To create the stacked barcharts, we will use the CO2 dataset. This involves:

Treatment variable, where:

* 50% chilled treatment
* 50% unchilled treatment

Type variable, where:

* 50% Quebec
* 50% Mississippi
