## R Markdown

|               This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown originally started as an R package, but has grown into its own RStudio environment for its versatility and power. R Markdown allows users to input text or images along with code to output documents or slide with built-in statistical analyses. Think of the power of SPSS, the reporting capabilities of MS Word, and the customizations of html and css in one place.

[More details on using R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) 

|               This is what a typical R Markdown document looks like. At the top of this script, you can choose to enter information into *or* completely delete. In the output, the text above will appear as a large header (title) and subheaders (author/date). When you click the **Knit** button (situated between the magnifying glass and settings cog above) a document will be generated that includes both written (textual) content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Wherever you choose to save this .Rnw file, your output typically follows. Try it now with this document! Save this to a known place -> Knit -> Read the output.
<font size="1"> I recommend knitting into html for simplicity's sake but all options should work. </font>


### Inline R Code and Code Chunks

|               If you wish to begin inputting R code, you will need to begin a "chunk" of code. Within the code chunk, you can write any number of lines that you need. Whatever text you put that is **not** within this code chunk will appear, as-is. Otherwise, any code written within the code chunk will function as normal. A "chunk" of embedded R code can be created with the following code: 
|
|
````
```{r}`r ''`
"enter your R code here"
```
````

<font size="1">Note: The tick-mark key can be found above the tab key. </font>

**If you do not include the code chunk around your R input, it will render as this:**

head(cars)

Whereas below shows the output when you include the same command within the chunk code. As you can see, this actually resulted in the running the command and creation of output:

```{r cars}
head(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, fig.align = "center"}
plot(cars)
```

### R Markdown Document Setup

````
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
````

|               You will notice that the code chunk above is automatically included in every R Markdown file that you create and can be found near the top of the script. {**Knitr**} is the R package that R Markdown entirely relies on -- later on, we will be doing some "knitting" to produce output. The code chunk above is standard because it tells R that any global settings you've made to your R software are applied to this R Markdown script. It is necessary for the functioning of this document, so avoid deleting it. 


Think of R as the "computer" and {Knitr} as the "printer". 

|               While you may not want the above code chunk to appear in your final rendered document (who would?), fret not! Inclusion of the code `include = FALSE` in the first line of curly brackets allows for it to not be printed with your output. As default, whatever you put in R chunks will appear in your rendered document unless indicated otherwise. Some other input options for the curly brackets that you may want to use (depending on your R code) are:
|
|
Curly Bracket Options | Description
------------- | ------------- 
`eval = FALSE` | Whether to evaluate the code and include its results (Default: TRUE)
`echo = FALSE` | Whether to display code along with its results (Default: TRUE)
`warning FALSE` | Whether to display warnings from your embedded code (Default: TRUE)
`error = TRUE` | Whether to display errors that result from your R code--*oops!*, (Default: FALSE)
`message = FALSE` | Whether to display messages regarding your code (Default: TRUE)
`tidy = TRUE` | Whether to reformat code in a tidy way when displaying it (Default: FALSE)
`results = "markup"` | "markup" "markup", "asis", "hold", or "hide" (Default: "markup")
`cache = TRUE` | Whether to cache results for future renders (Default: FALSE)
`comment = symbol` | Comment character to preface results with (Default: "#")
`fig.width = whatever value you wish` | Width in inches for plots created in chunk (Default: 7in.)
`fig.height = whatever value you wish` | Height in inches for plots created in chunk (Default: 7in.)
`fig.align = "center"` | Aligning how output will be printed in your document; "center", "left", "right" (Default: "left")


|               I have never found the need to adjust the `tidy`, `results`, or `cache` options above -- if you choose to edit these, make sure you know what you are doing. It is worth noting that the `echo = FALSE` parameter is crucial to add to code chunks in order to prevent printing of redundant or unnecessary R code that would be seen in the output. If you are installing packages, loading libraries, reformatting/creating datasets, creating functions, or making extensively large custom plots, your reader likely does not want to work through each line of code that would be printed in your output. It would be wise to suppress the displaying of this code so that your reader can move through your document more effectively. For the purposes of reproducibility and open science, your code will still remain within *this* .Rnw file, but will not be rendered into the *final* html, Word, or pdf document after Knitting.

### R Markdown Headers

|               When you are wanting to label the heading of your content, you can choose between 6 sizes. Including the text "#" before your text will result in the largest header R Markdown has, while including the text "######" (six hash signs) will rseult in the smallest header. Any number of hash signs inbetween will render smaller headers, ascending from "#" to "######". 
<center> # Four
## Score
### And
#### Seven
##### Years
###### Ago 
</center>
| In the end, it's up to you decide which size works best for you!

### R Markdown Lists and Quotes

##### Bulleted list

* item 1 = asterisk (*), space, and then your first item
* item 2 = new line (i.e. hit return), asterisk (*), space, and your second item
    + sub-item 1 = new line (hit return), indentation, plus sign, and then sub-item content
    + sub-item 2 = new line, indentation, plus sign, and then sub-item content

##### Numerically-ordered

1. item 1 = "1.", space, and first item
2. item 2 = new line, "2.", space, second item
    + sub-item 1 = new line, indentation, plus sign, and then content
    + sub-item 2 = new line, indentation, plus sign, and then content
 
##### Block Quotes

Inclusion of ">" preceding your quote.

> Hello reader! It is currently 82$^\circ$ here in lovely Lincoln, Nebraska.

Wrap text in brackets, [words], immediately followed by your desired link in parentheses, (link), to make hyperlinked text | [MERC Homepage](https://merc.unl.edu/)
End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph | Just try this one out yourself..

### Font Sizing, Position, and Type via HTML/css
##### Sizing
|               One way to edit the size of your font is through the capabilities of html. If you prefer css code, that also works here! To change your font size with HTML, wrap your text with `<font size = "number"> "enter your content here" </font>`. You can also better specify your font size by point size, where `<p style = font-size: "insert number"pt>` followed by </p> would result in whatever point font you'd like.

<font size="1"> This is my text number1</font>, <font size="2"> text number 2 </font>, <font size="3"> text number 3</font>, <font size="4"> text number 4</font>, <font size="5"> text number 5</font>, <font size="6"> and text number 6</font>.

 <center><p style = font-size:18pt>This is 18 point font!</p></center>
|
##### Text Position
|               When you find the need to align your text into a certain place on the page, it's easiest to wrap your text with either `<p style = "text-align: left/center/right">` followed by `</p>`. Per usual, the default is for your text to align left.
|
|
<p style = "text-align: left">This is text aligned to the **left**</p>
<p style = "text-align: center">This is what it appears with **centered** alignment</p>
<p style = "text-align: right">While this is what it looks like to align text to the **right**</p>
|
##### Font Type
|               While the default font is Arial, there are are ways to change the font type, size, and alignment of the rendered output. Let's put all of the things we've learned about p style together into one. Do so by including `<p style = "font-family: insert font name; font-size: insert number; text-align: insert alignment choice"`, filling out the desired font name/size number/alignment, and following your text with `</p>`. For example, below I am using the "times" (time new roman) font, "12pt" size, and a centered alignment.
| 
| 
<p style="font-family: times; font-size:12pt; text-align:center"> **This is likely a more suitable font for APA style reports.** </p>

##### Other Fonts & Outcomes
<p style="font-family: times; font-size:12pt"> times -- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. </p>
<p style="font-family: georgia; font-size:12pt">georgia -- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. </p>
<p style="font-family: courier; font-size:12pt">courier -- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. </p>
<p style="font-family: serif; font-size:12pt">serif -- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. </p>
<p style="font-family: verdana; font-size:12pt">verdana -- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. </p>
<p style="font-family: cursive; font-size:12pt">cursive -- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. </p>
<p style="font-family: trebuchet ms; font-size:12pt">trebuchet ms -- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. </p>

### Indenting Text

|               Indenting text in an R Markdown document requires more effort than simply tabbing over. The process of including purposeful space before a sentence or paragraph is not difficult, and has been used throughout this very document. To create text indent, include a vertical bar (a "|" symbol, *not* a capital "i"!) before your text. This will preserve whatever indentation you place *after* the vertical bar. So essentially, place a | before the first sentence in your paragraph, use the tab key to create indented space, and your text will render into what can be seen in paragraph 1 below. On the other hand, excluding this will result in the paragraph 2.

| As one may deduce, adding the | and your spacing to *each* line of text inputted will indent every line.
