## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown originally started as an R package, but has grown into its own RStudio environment for its versatility and power. R Markdown allows users to input text or images along with code to output documents or slide with built-in statistical analyses. Think of the power of SPSS, the reporting capabilites of MS Word, and the customizations of html and css in one place.

[More details on using R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) 

This is what a typical R Markdown document looks like. At the top of this script, you can choose to enter information into *or* completely delete. In the output, the text above will appear as a large header (title) and subheaders (author/date). 

### Inline R Code and Code Chunks

If you wish to begin inputting R code, you will need to begin a "chunk" of code. Within the code chunk, you can write any number of lines that you need.
If you do not begin your R input without a chunk of code, whatever text you put that is **not** within this code chunk will appear, as-is. A "chunk" of embedded R code can be created with the following code: 

| ```{r}
| enter your R code here
| ``` 
<font size="1">Note: The tick-mark key is available above the tab key. </font>

As an example, if you do not include the code chunk around your R input, it will render as this:

head(cars)

Whereas below includes the chunking code:

```{r cars}
head(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

### R Markdown Setup

| ```{r setup, include = FALSE}
| knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
| ```

You will notice that the code chunk above is automatically included in every R Markdown file that you create and can be found near the top of the script. {Knitr} is the R package that R Markdown entirely relies on -- later on, we will be doing some "knitting" to produce output. The code chunk above is standard because it tells R that any global settings you've made to your R software are applied to this R Markdown script. It is necessary for the functioning of this document, so avoid deleting it. 

Think of R as the "computer" and {Knitr} as the "printer". 

While you may not want the code chunk to appear in your final rendered document (who would?), fret not! Inclusion of the code `include = FALSE` in the first line of curly brackets allows for it to not be printed with your output. As default, whatever you put in R chunks will appear in your rendered document unless indicated otherwise. Some other input options for the curly brackets that you may want to use (depending on your R code) are:

Curly Bracket Options | Description
------------- | ------------- 
`eval = FALSE` | Whether to evaluate the code and include its results (Default: TRUE)
`echo = FALSE` | Whether to display code along with its results (Default: TRUE)
`warning FALSE` | Whether to display warnings from your embedded code (Default: TRUE)
`error = TRUE` | Whether to display errors that result from your R code--*oops!*, (Default: FALSE)
`message = FALSE` | Whether to display messages regarding your code (Default: TRUE)
`tidy = TRUE` | Whether to reformat code in a tidy way when displaying it (Default: FALSE)
`results = "markup"` | "markup" "markup", "asis", "hold", or "hide" (Default: "markup")
`cache = TRUE` | Whether to cache results for future renders (Default: FALSE)
`comment = symbol` | Comment character to preface results with (Default: "#")
`fig.width = whatever value you wish` | Width in inches for plots created in chunk (Default: 7in.)
`fig.height = whatever value you wish` | Height in inches for plots created in chunk (Default: 7in.)

### R Markdown Headers

When you are wanting to label the heading of your content, you can choose between 6 sizes. Including the text "#" before your text will result in the largest header R Markdown has, while including the text "######" (six hash signs) will rseult in the smallest header. Any number of hash signs inbetween will render smaller headers, ascending from "#" to "######". 

### R Markdown Lists and Quotes

###### Bulleted list

* item 1
* item 2
 + sub-item 1
 + sub-item 2

###### Numerically-ordered

1. item 2
2. item 3
 + sub-item 1
 + sub-item 2 
 
###### Block Quotes

Inclusion of ">" preceding your quote.

> Hello reader! It is currently 82$^\circ$ here in lovely Lincoln, Nebraska.

### R Markdown Font Formatting

Instructions | Results
------------- | -------------
Wrap your text with asterisks or underscores | *italicized text*
Wrap your text with two asterisks or underscores | **bolded text**
Wrap your text with carrot symbols (^) | superscripts^2^
Wrap your text with two tildes (~) | ~~strikethrough text~~
Warp text in brackets, [words], immediately followed by your desired link in parentheses, (link), to make hyperlinked text | [MERC Homepage](https://merc.unl.edu/)
End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph | Just try this one out yourself..

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both written (textual) content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
